# NOTE:
# If you still SEE __pycache__ files in a GUI (e.g. GitHub Desktop), possible reasons:
# 1. 'Show Ignored Files' is enabled in the GUI.
# 2. The file was previously tracked and the deletion hasn't been committed.
# 3. You're comparing against a branch/commit where it existed.
# 4. Local filesystem still has the file (normal) but Git is not tracking it.
# You can remove all caches anytime with:  make clean-pyc
